## Hello World!
--

### Who I am

I am HT/Jinghu, current Ph.D. student in Department of Mechanical Engineering, University of Texas at Austin. Before that, I obtained my M.S. and B.Eng. in Tsinghua University, Beijing China. 

### My research field

My current research project is to optimize the emission process in the direct injection engine during the cold start, thus reducing the emission so that it could meet the more stringent emission standards. 

My past research includes the analytical and numerical research on the underexpanded high pressure hydrogen jet flow. 

Besides my research, I have experience in natural language processsing and text-to-speech (TTS) voice synthesis technologies based on deep learning models.

### My hobbies

I love travelling, reading and sports. I used to play on school flag football🏈 team. I am also a music fan with a huge genre & style🎧.
